<p class="text-end"><em>I don't need a basket, I'm just picking one or two things.</em></p>

<p>This is the first of what I've called <b>Mini pitch</b>, small projects I want to make during a week, with short and
    quick pace based on a little idea I had. My plan is to grow this series when I have time to develop it.</p>

<p>Supermarket Nightmare is based on my personal experience, as dumb as when I convince myself that I don't need a basket or a bag when I'm going to the supermarket. And I keep failing everytime, juggling with my groceries as I get back home. </p>

<p>My main motivation here was to represent how crowd of elements are supermarkets. I enjoyed a lot creating all the products, fruits, vegetables, packagings, in 3D and also crafting textures and designing some labels that can have some reminiscence to real life products.</p>

<p>For the character, I also wanted to play with hair and fur, adding a lot of realism inside her being cartoony.</p>

<p>Posing was key, she has to give the impression of being overwhelmed by the situation, so it was important to make her torsionated, carrying a lot of products, with a worried expression.</p>
