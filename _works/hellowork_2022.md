SocialClub Paris reached out BOL to create a relatable, easy-going TV commercial campaign for HelloWork, announcing its new name and the merge of several job search sites into the new platform. As an artist from BOL's roster, I'm very proud to have co-directed this project with them, and art directing the whole campaign. 

The campaign consists of a 25 seconds hero video (Candidats) toying with funny and common examples of bad practices when it comes to finding a job, plus 2 short videos (Le Café and L’Ascenseur) communicating the name change.

Simplicity was key, both for the style and the tone of voice: an almost toy-like environment creates a tender, innocent mood, while leaving plenty of creative space for the quirky characters and ironic humor that defines the Candidats video.

Style wise, we opted for a heavy stop-motion influence, mixed with thick, scaled elements, with a plastic, toy feel to them. So we decided to focus on this direction and opted for stop-motion aesthetics with a tangible twist, always keeping simplicity in mind.
