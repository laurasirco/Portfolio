<p class="text-end"><em>Managing job opportunities has never been easier! Whether you're out fishing, enjoying live
        streams, or making
        plans
        with friends, Hellowork transforms the job quest into a seamless and enjoyable experience.</em></p>


<p>“Our Job” is the second campaign directed by Device & Laura Sirvent for Social Club Paris. It incorporates 7-second
    pieces with a strong stop-motion influence, combining thick, rounded elements for a charm, handmade-like feel. The
    style features soft elements and vibrant colors with minimalist aesthetics, showcasing the effortless and fun space
    of the Hellowork application process.</p>

<p>We were approached to create three different short videos following new situations for the same characters that we
    created in the previous campaign. The main idea was to convey situations in where Hellowork can help people to find
    a
    job.</p>

<p>The characters were the same as in the original campaign, but we had to tweak them a little bit to fit in these new
    situations that they were put into.</p>

<p>For <b>At Home</b>, she's back in form of influencer, recording a short video for her followers, so we wanted to put
    her at her living room, with comfy clothes, that express coziness and confidence.</p>

<p>Her house must be colorful and bold, with lots of sun light, as she's in her late morning, enjoying her coffee as she
    speaks with trust with her followers. So her couch must look super comfortable, with a modern lamp at the back. We
    wanted to add a small but useful kitchen, also a cute sideboard for her turntable, LPs and books. And also we wanted
    to feature plants, lots of plants.</p>

<p>A good way to create spaces is to craft them as small corners full of elements, with matching shapes and colors.</p>

</div>

<p>Then, for <b>Everywhere</b>, we wanted here to create some physical comedy, as this character is the more playful
    one, he moves in a comical way, twisting and bending his body with lots of jittery energy. Also, we feature here a
    unexpected guest, a huge fish!</p>

<p>He's enjoying some fishing at a gorgeous environment, a sunset lake, taking a nap while he waits for a fish to bite
    the trap. </p>

<div class="row g-1 my-5">

<p>For him, his outfit is totally on point, wearing all he needs in order to become a proper fisherman, or at least to
    try it. A square patterned shirt, pants with pockets, also a vest with pockets, a hat to not get an insolation, and
    a convenient pair of rubber boots.</p>

<div class="row g-1 my-5">

</div>

<img class="center my-4" src="/assets/projects/our_job_hellowork/everywhere_persnaje.png">

<p>The fish is the unexpected guest, as he appears at the end, without our main character noticing him, despite of his
    huge size.</p>

<img class="center my-4 w-50" src="/assets/projects/our_job_hellowork/pez.png">

<p>Lastly, for <b>After</b>, the main idea was to express the piece and calm of her after knowing all the conditions and
    details of the job offer she just received. By knowing this, we wanted to create a room at the evening, with warm
    light, crowded with cozy furniture, featuring some buildings and a starlight sky at the outside.</p>

<img class="center my-4" src="/assets/projects/our_job_hellowork/03_After_01.png">

<p>Her outfit was mainly based on the idea that she's ready to hang with a friend, so she's wearing not too overdressed, with denim pants, a cute wool sweater, and a pair of cool sneakers.</p>

<p>As in At Home scene, we wanted to craft an interior set, full of details, so thinking of them as a small stack of elementes, that matched in color palette and shapes helped a lot.</p>
